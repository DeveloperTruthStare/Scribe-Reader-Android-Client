Page estimation


Reader
- Shows the paragraph without any flare
- Tap on a word - toggles furigana for that word
- Double tap on a word - toggles  furigana and underlines for whole paragraph
- Hold on a word - sends paragraph to dictionary, focusing on the token held on

Only show furigana if there is kanji in the token
Honestly, maybe don't ever show the underlines except in the dictionary view
